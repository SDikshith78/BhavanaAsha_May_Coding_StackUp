## 🕊️ BHAVAASHA Project

**Meaning**: From Sanskrit — *Bhavana* (emotion) + *Asha* (hope)  
> *"BhavaAsha — where emotion and hope linger like memories that never fade."*

This project is a soulful blend of design, performance, and purpose, inspired by the timeless emotions that define human memory.

## 🔖 Notes & Limitations

- All APIs used (Cloudinary, Supabase, Shotstack) are free-tier. Due to this:
  - Some loading delays may occur.
  - AI video generation might take time. Be patient, especially when using the AI tab.
  - After uploading, visit the **Home** page to view your generated video.

- **Authentication**:  
  While Supabase was included, due to time constraints and technical issues, failed to authenticate. And is not implemented yet.

--- Note: Please be patient while visiting, photos, video sections(atlast 5-6 seconds) and also while generating videos take time since it is free AI API key depends upon pics/song selection and process.
-- Creating AI genrating video have credits, once its gone we cant generate AI edit video so be careful. But for now you can Generate 3-5 videos.
--- I hope you understand it
